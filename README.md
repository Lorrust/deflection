## Core Gameplay ðŸ¥‹

- **The Duel**:  
  Two samurais stand on opposite sides of the arena, facing each other. A single shuriken is flung between them, and the goal is to deflect it at the perfect moment.  

- **Mechanics**:  
  - **Deflection**: When the shuriken approaches, press the deflect button at the right time to send it back to your opponent.  
  - **Miss Penalty**: Missing the deflection causes the shuriken to strike the player, earning the opponent a point.  
  - **Increasing Speed**: As the match progresses, the shuriken speeds up, making each round more intense.
